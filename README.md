#   Solar Power Prediction 
In week 1 project for creating a Linear Regression model for predicting the solar power generated using the 'solar power generation' dataset, I imported necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn and loaded the dataset and checked for missing values and duplicates and finally displayed a detailed histogram graph for the power generated.
In week 2, I performed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and displayed histogram and scatterplot for columns and found the correlation using the heatmap and detected the outliers using the boxplot.
