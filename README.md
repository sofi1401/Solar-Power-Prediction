#   Solar Power Prediction 
In week 1 project for creating a Linear Regression model for predicting the solar power generated using the 'solar power generation' dataset, I imported necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn and loaded the dataset and checked for missing values and duplicates and finally displayed a detailed histogram graph for the power generated.
In week 2, I performed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and displayed histogram and scatterplot for columns and found the correlation using the heatmap and detected the outliers using the boxplot.
In week 3, I have built a Machine Learning Model to predict the Solar Power Generation by importing necessary libraries, split the data into train and test set and saled the dataset, later trained the model using Linear Regression Model, at last evaluate the model by finding the Mean Absolute Error for both testing and training set.
