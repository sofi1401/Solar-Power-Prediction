# Week-1
In this week 1 project for creating a Linear Regression model for predicting the solar power generated using the 'solar power generation' dataset, I imported necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn and loaded the dataset and checked for missing values and duplicates and finally displayed a detailed histogram graph for the power generated.
